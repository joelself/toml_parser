# [We've Moved](https://github.com/joelself/tomllib/)!
### I changed the the name of the project to `tomllib` a while ago, but didn't want to change the URL because people were already linking to it. However, in anticipation of my first release I figured it's either now or never, so I [moved the repository to its new url that reflects its name: https://github.com/joelself/tomllib](https://github.com/joelself/tomllib).
![tomllib logo](https://dislocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tomllib_logo1.svg)          ![tomlkit logo](https://dislocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tomlkit_logo1.svg)
#### I wrote a blog post about my adventures in creating method macros in __nom__. [Give it a read](https://wp.me/p7ikGY-3g)!
## `tomllib` is a parser, modifier, and generator for TOML files ***that doesn't judge you***! 

######It is written in Rust using [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom). `tomlkit` is the command line tool that has the same functionality as the library  (but doesn't actually exist yet, but then again neither does the library).

## What?

The project's not here anymore.

## Where is it?

It's here: [https://github.com/joelself/tomllib/](https://github.com/joelself/tomllib/)

## Why?

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/joelself/tomllib.git

```
